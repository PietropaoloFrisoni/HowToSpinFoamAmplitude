# HowToSpinfoamAmplitude  


In the notebook you can find the codes for the computation of the Δ₄ spinfoam amplitude.

The amplitudes are (also) stored in CSV format in their respective paths.

The EPRL vertices were computed with the *sl2cfoam-next* library: [sl2cfoam-next](https://github.com/qg-cpt-marseille/sl2cfoam-next).

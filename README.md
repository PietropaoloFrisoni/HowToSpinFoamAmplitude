### Computing the Δ4 spinfoam amplitude

**This repository is intended as additional material and goes hand in hand with** [this paper](https://github.com/).

In the two *Jupyter lab* notebooks there are the codes which show how to compute the EPRL Δ4 spinfoam triangulation.
The codes have been written and tested with the *julia 1.7.0* kernel.

We employ the [sl2cfoam-next](https://github.com/qg-cpt-marseille/sl2cfoam-next) library for the EPRL vertex amplitude computation.
See also the [paper describing the library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13952).

We also leave the *Mathematica* notebook used for some Fits and Plots, as well as the bash script to compute amplitudes using a supercluster.
In this case, Compute Canada's [Narval](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Narval/en) cluster was used (*SLURM* scheduler).

We hope these tools are useful, and we wish you a lot of fun!

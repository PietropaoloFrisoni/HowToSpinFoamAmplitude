# HowToSpinfoamAmplitude  


In the notebook there is the code for the Δ₄ spinfoam amplitude computation.

The amplitudes are stored in CSV/JLD2 format.

The EPRL vertex amplitudes have been computed with the *sl2cfoam-next* library: [sl2cfoam-next](https://github.com/qg-cpt-marseille/sl2cfoam-next).

See also: [paper describing the library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13952).
